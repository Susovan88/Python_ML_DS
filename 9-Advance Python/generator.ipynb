    "### -> What is a Generator?\n",
    "\n",
    "A generator is a special kind of iterator in Python.\n",
    "You create it using:\n",
    "Functions with the 'yield' keyword.\n",
    "Or generator expressions (like list comprehensions, but lazy).\n",
    "Unlike normal functions that return a value and exit, a generator “pauses” at yield and resumes where it left off when you call next() again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### -> How Generators Save Memory ??\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use normal functions or lists, Python stores all elements in memory at once.\n",
    "But generators don’t store anything in memory.\n",
    "They generate one value at a time, only when you ask for it.\n",
    "This is called lazy evaluation.\n",
    "You can create an infinite sequence without memory issues using generator"
