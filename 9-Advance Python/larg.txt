Python is a powerful programming language.
It is widely used in web development, data science, AI, and automation.
Generators in Python allow you to process large files efficiently.
They yield one item at a time and save memory.
This makes generators ideal for reading big files or streams.
Python makes handling big data very easy with its simple syntax.
Remember: a generator pauses at yield and resumes on next().
This file is created to test how generators handle large data.
