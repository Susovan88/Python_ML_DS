    "# Module: Inheritance Assignments\n",
    "## Lesson: Single and Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "### Assignment 1: Single Inheritance Basic\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a base class named `Animal` with attributes `name` and `species`. Create a derived class named `Dog` that inherits from `Animal` and adds an attribute `breed`. Create an object of the `Dog` class and print its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 2: Method Overriding in Single Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `Dog` class, override the `__str__` method to return a string representation of the object. Create an object of the class and print it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 3: Single Inheritance with Additional Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `Dog` class, add a method named `bark` that prints a barking sound. Create an object of the class and call the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 4: Multiple Inheritance Basic\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a base class named `Walker` with a method `walk` that prints a walking message. Create another base class named `Runner` with a method `run` that prints a running message. Create a derived class named `Athlete` that inherits from both `Walker` and `Runner`. Create an object of the `Athlete` class and call both methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 5: Method Resolution Order (MRO) in Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `Athlete` class, override the `walk` method to print a different message. Create an object of the class and call the `walk` method. Use the `super()` function to call the `walk` method of the `Walker` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 6: Multiple Inheritance with Additional Attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `Athlete` class, add an attribute `training_hours` and a method `train` that prints the training hours. Create an object of the class and call the method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 7: Diamond Problem in Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class named `A` with a method `show` that prints a message. Create two derived classes `B` and `C` that inherit from `A` and override the `show` method. Create a class `D` that inherits from both `B` and `C`. Create an object of the `D` class and call the `show` method. Observe the method resolution order.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 8: Using `super()` in Single Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a base class named `Shape` with an attribute `color`. Create a derived class named `Circle` that inherits from `Shape` and adds an attribute `radius`. Use the `super()` function to initialize the attributes. Create an object of the `Circle` class and print its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 9: Using `super()` in Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class named `Person` with an attribute `name`. Create a class named `Employee` with an attribute `employee_id`. Create a derived class `Manager` that inherits from both `Person` and `Employee`. Use the `super()` function to initialize the attributes. Create an object of the `Manager` class and print its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 10: Method Overriding and `super()`\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class named `Vehicle` with a method `start` that prints a starting message. Create a derived class `Car` that overrides the `start` method to print a different message. Use the `super()` function to call the `start` method of the `Vehicle` class. Create an object of the `Car` class and call the `start` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 11: Multiple Inheritance with Different Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class named `Flyer` with a method `fly` that prints a flying message. Create a class named `Swimmer` with a method `swim` that prints a swimming message. Create a derived class `Superhero` that inherits from both `Flyer` and `Swimmer`. Create an object of the `Superhero` class and call both methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 12: Complex Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a class named `Base1` with an attribute `a`. Create a class named `Base2` with an attribute `b`. Create a class named `Derived` that inherits from both `Base1` and `Base2` and adds an attribute `c`. Initialize all attributes using the `super()` function. Create an object of the `Derived` class and print its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 13: Checking Instance Types with Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a base class named `Animal` and a derived class named `Cat`. Create objects of both classes and use the `isinstance` function to check the instance types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 14: Polymorphism with Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a base class named `Bird` with a method `speak`. Create two derived classes `Parrot` and `Penguin` that override the `speak` method. Create a list of `Bird` objects and call the `speak` method on each object to demonstrate polymorphism.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assignment 15: Combining Single and Multiple Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a base class named `Device` with an attribute `brand`. Create a derived class `Phone` that inherits from `Device` and adds an attribute `model`. Create another base class `Camera` with an attribute `resolution`. Create a derived class `Smartphone` that inherits from both `Phone` and `Camera`. Create an object of the `Smartphone` class and print its attributes."
