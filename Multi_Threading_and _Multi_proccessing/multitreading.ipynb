    "### program\n",
    "✅ A program is just a set of instructions written in a programming language that tells the computer what to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "📦 Think of a program as a recipe in a cookbook.\n",
    "But until someone opens the recipe and starts cooking, it’s just instructions sitting in a book.\n",
    "\n",
    "📄 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "A file like calculator.exe or my_app.py on your computer is a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "It isn’t running yet—it’s just stored on disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Process\n",
    "✅ A process is a program that’s been loaded into memory and is running.\n",
    "It’s like following the recipe and actually cooking.\n",
    "\n",
    "📦 When you double-click a program (like opening Chrome), your computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loads it into RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gives it resources (CPU time, memory, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "Starts running it.\n",
    "\n",
    "📝 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "You double-click Google Chrome → Now Chrome is a process running on your system.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you open Chrome 3 times → You have 3 processes of Chrome running.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Thread\n",
    "✅ A thread is the smallest unit of execution within a process.\n",
    "\n",
    "A process can have one thread (default) or many threads working together.\n",
    "\n",
    "Threads in the same process share memory and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "📦 Analogy:\n",
    "Imagine the process is a restaurant 🍽️:\n",
    "\n",
    "One thread = 1 waiter serving food.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple threads = multiple waiters serving tables at the same time.\n",
    "They all work in the same restaurant (process) and share the same kitchen (memory)."

    "### Multithreading \n",
    "Multithreading is a concept where a program can perform multiple tasks at the same time (concurrently) by using multiple “threads” of execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of a thread as a lightweight process—a small unit of a program that can run independently.\n",
