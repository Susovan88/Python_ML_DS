"""
ðŸ§  What is ProcessPoolExecutor?
ProcessPoolExecutor is part of Pythonâ€™s concurrent.futures module.

It lets you run multiple tasks in parallel, but each task runs in a separate process.

It uses the multiprocessing module internally.

Think of it like this:
ðŸ“¦ You have a pool of workers (processes).
âš¡ Each worker runs on a different CPU core, so tasks can execute truly in parallel.

âš¡ Why use ProcessPoolExecutor?
âœ… It allows you to use multiple CPU cores to speed up CPU-intensive tasks.

Examples:
âœ” Complex math (factorials, matrix multiplications).
âœ” Data processing on large datasets.
âœ” Image or video processing.

ðŸ•‘ When to use ProcessPoolExecutor?
Use it if:
âœ… Your program spends most time doing calculations.
âœ… You want real parallelism (not just concurrency).
âœ… Your task is CPU-bound, not waiting for input/output.

Donâ€™t use it for I/O-bound tasksâ€”itâ€™s overkill.

ðŸ§  Why do we need if __name__ == "__main__": for multiprocessing?
When you use multiprocessing, Python creates new processes by importing your script as a module.

If you donâ€™t protect the entry point with:

python
Copy code
if __name__ == "__main__":
then every new process will execute the entire script again, leading to infinite process creation (or crashing your program).
